"""
Signal-Lambda Slots Example

This example demonstrates connecting a signal to a lambda function slot.
It shows that you can quickly define inline, anonymous slots for simple tasks.

Steps:
1. Define a signal in a class (Counter) that emits when its count changes.
2. Connect the signal to a lambda function that prints the received value.
3. Increment the counter and observe the lambda being called.

Key Points:
- Demonstrates that slots can be lambdas (anonymous functions).
- Useful for quick, inline actions without defining a separate function or method.
